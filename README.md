## Architecture

The library consists of three layers:

1. **Managed Layer**: Clean, idiomatic C# API with async/await support (not true async)
2. **Interop Layer**: P/Invoke bindings to libssh2 native library
3. **Native Layer**: Pre-compiled libssh2 binaries for all supported platforms

All native dependencies are bundled in the NuGet package for zero-configuration deployment.
